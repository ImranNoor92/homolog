# Specific Aim 2: Design and Test Candidates from Uncultured Viral Genomes

## Objective
Design and test novel AAV capsid protein candidates by mining uncultured viral genomes, focusing on naturally occurring T=3 capsids within the *Parvoviridae* family. This approach aims to circumvent the limitation in Specific Aim 1, where T=3-forming regions in distant relatives may not efficiently promote T=3 architecture in AAVs.

---

## Rationale
While Specific Aim 1 explores T=3-compatible regions from distant viruses, this aim focuses on **closer relatives to AAV**, such as members of the *Parvoviridae* family. We hypothesize that **uncultured parvoviruses with unusually large genomes** may naturally encode T=3 capsid proteins. By identifying and modeling these candidates, we can create **better-adapted T=3 capsids** for AAV engineering.

This strategy builds upon successful discoveries from the Luque Lab, which previously identified novel small capsids (T=1 and T=3) in tailed phages not observed in isolated viruses.

## Strategy Overview

### 1. **Database Mining**
- Download the **IMG/VR database** of uncultured viral genomes from the **DOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI)**.
- Select **genomes >6 kb** from the **Parvoviridae** family.

### 2. **Taxonomic Classification and ORF Prediction**
- Run the **VIRify** pipeline for classification at the **genus and family levels** (expected ~86.6% accuracy).
- Identify **open reading frames (ORFs)** using **Prodigal** (primary) and **Glimmer** (supplementary, for eukaryotic viruses).

### 3. **Functional Annotation**
- Annotate ORFs using **hmmscan** against the **Pfam** database.
- Select sequences containing hits to **single jelly roll capsid domains**.

### 4. **Structure Prediction and Assembly**
- Use **RoseTTAFold** and **AlphaFold** to predict the **3D structures** of candidate capsid proteins.
- Apply **AlphaFold-Multimer** to model **trimeric assemblies**.
- Arrange trimeric tiles into **T=1 and T=3 capsid architectures**.

### 5. **Theoretical Biophysical Evaluation**
- Analyze predicted capsid assemblies using **biophysical simulations** (from C.1.2 in Specific Aim 1).
- Identify stable T=3 candidates and the **key edge fragments** responsible for T=3 assembly.

### 6. **Structural Comparison with AAV2**
- Compare uncultured capsid trimeric tiles with **AAV2 trimers** using **ChimeraX matchmaking**.
- Identify AAV2 protein regions requiring integration of **T=3-enabling fragments**.

### 7. **Candidate Design and Testing**
- Define a **design library** of AAV2-based capsid protein variants.
- Refine and prioritize **at least 20 candidates** using methods from Specific Aim 1 (C.1.2 and C.1.3).

## Goal
Develop and test a set of **â‰¥20 engineered AAV capsid variants** that incorporate T=3-enabling motifs from uncultured *Parvoviridae* genomes, yielding larger, more stable capsids suitable for therapeutic applications.
